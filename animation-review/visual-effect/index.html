            <h2>Somewhere over the rainbow</h2>
            <p>
              Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high And the dreams that you
              dreamed of Once in a lullaby
            </p>
            <p>
              Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly And the dreams that you
              dreamed of Dreams really do come true Someday I'll wish upon a
              star Wake up where the clouds are far Behind me Where trouble
              melts like lemon drops High above the chimney top That's where
              you'll find me
            </p>
            <p>
              Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly And the dream that you
              dare to, Oh why, oh why can't I? Well I see trees of green and red
              roses too, I'll watch them bloom for me and you And I think to
              myself What a wonderful world Well I see skies of blue And I see
              clouds of white And the brightness of day I like the dark And I
              think to myself What a wonderful world The colors of the rainbow
              so pretty in the sky Are also on the faces of people passing by I
              see friends shaking hands Singing, "How do you do?" They really
              sing, "I...I love you" I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
              They'll learn much more than we'll know And I think to myself What
              a wonderful world world Someday I'll wish upon a star Wake up
              where the clouds are far Behind me Where trouble melts like lemon
              drops High above the chimney top That's where you'll find me
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh, somewhere over the rainbow Way up high And the dream that you
              dare to Why, oh why can't I? I?
