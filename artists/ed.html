          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes<br />
            But it's the only thing that I know<br />
            When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes<br />
            It is the only thing makes us feel alive<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            keep this love in a photograph<br />
            We made these memories for ourselves<br />
            Where our eyes are never closing<br />
            Hearts are never broken And time's forever frozen still<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            So you can keep me Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br />
            Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet<br />
            You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home<br />
          </p>

            I found a love for me Darling just dive right in And follow my lead
            Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet I never knew you were the
            someone waiting for me 'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
          </p>
          <p>
            Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on
            the grass, listening to our favorite song When you said you looked a
            mess, I whispered underneath my breath But you heard it, darling,
            you look perfect tonight
          </p>
